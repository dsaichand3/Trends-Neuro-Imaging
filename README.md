### Neuro Imaging
Human brain research is among the most complex areas of study for scientists. We know that age and other factors can affect its function and structure, but more research is needed into what specifically occurs within the brain. With much of the research using MRI scans, data scientists are well positioned to support future insights. In particular, neuroimaging specialists look for measurable markers of behavior, health, or disorder to help identify relevant brain regions and their contribution to typical or symptomatic effects.


In this competition, we predict multiple assessments plus age from multimodal brain MRI features. We will be working from existing results from other data scientists, doing the important work of validating the utility of multimodal features in a normative population of unaffected subjects. Due to the complexity of the brain and differences between scanners, generalized approaches will be essential to effectively propel multimodal neuroimaging research forward.
